# RFM Analysis

RFM Analysis is a customer segmentation technique used to understand and categorize customers based on their buying behavior. The acronym RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, three key metrics that provide insights into customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

## Purpose

The purpose of RFM Analysis is to segment customers effectively, enabling businesses to tailor targeted marketing strategies and personalized approaches for each segment. By analyzing:

- **Recency:** The date of the customer's last purchase.
- **Frequency:** How often customers make purchases.
- **Monetary Value:** The amount spent on purchases.

Businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their customers and optimize their marketing efforts.

## Dataset

To perform RFM Analysis, a dataset is required, including customer IDs, purchase dates, and transaction amounts. You can find a sample dataset at [US Regional Sales Data](https://data.world/dataman-udit/us-regional-sales-data).

## Customer Segmentation

Customers are typically divided into three value segments based on average RFM Scores:

- **High-Value (Top 20%):** Customers with high recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- **Mid-Value (Next 30%):** Customers with moderate recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- **Low-Value (Next 50%):** Customers with lower recency, frequency, and monetary value.

## Customer Segments

When segmenting customers based on RFM Analysis, five common segments can be considered:

1. **VIP Customers:** High-value customers making recent and frequent purchases with a substantial monetary value. They are the most loyal and valuable customers.

2. **Regular Customers:** Customers who make frequent purchases contributing to consistent sales, even though their monetary value may not be the highest.

3. **Dormant Customers:** Customers who haven't made a purchase in a while, requiring targeted marketing efforts to reactivate them.

4. **New Customers:** Customers who have recently made their first purchase. They require nurturing and engagement to encourage repeat purchases and long-term loyalty.

5. **Churned Customers:** Customers who were once active but haven't made a purchase in a long time. They require re-engagement strategies to win them back and prevent them from churning.
