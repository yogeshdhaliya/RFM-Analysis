## 1. Introduction

RFM analysis is a powerful method used to classify customers into different segments based on their purchasing patterns. It evaluates:  
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.  
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes purchases.  
- **Monetary**: How much money a customer spends.  

The outcome of the analysis helps businesses identify high-value customers, understand customer loyalty, and improve overall engagement.

## 2. Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:  
1. To calculate RFM metrics for each customer.  
2. To assign RFM scores and segment customers based on their purchase behavior.  
3. To visualize customer segments for better understanding and actionable insights.

## 4. Steps Overview

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
   - Remove duplicates and handle missing values.  
   - Convert date columns to appropriate datetime formats.  

2. **Calculate RFM Metrics**  
   - **Recency**: Calculate the number of days since the last transaction.  
   - **Frequency**: Count the number of transactions for each customer.  
   - **Monetary**: Sum the total transaction value for each customer.  

3. **Assign RFM Scores**  
   - Rank each metric on a scale (e.g., 1-5) to standardize scores.  
   - Combine scores to form an overall RFM score.  

4. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Group customers into segments such as Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, etc.  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Create charts and graphs to visualize segment distributions and insights.
